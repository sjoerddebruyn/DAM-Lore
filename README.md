Abstract
Our project is a website that provides users a comprehensive history of the OSU campus and the surrounding corvallis area through a landmark map, location history page, “must-trys” and recommendations page, home page, and a creators team page. The website will serve as a cultural and historical collection for all matters such as building history, notable natural locations, cultural landmarks, unnoticed odds and ends, etc.

Goal
Our application will allow users to discover much more about the place they live/visit and give a better representation of Corvallis and OSU. It will solve the problem for students, visitors, and parents alike to find things to do close by and contain multilingual capabilities for the vast international community.
